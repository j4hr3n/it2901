\section{Evaluation of Existing Solutions}
Seven different web solutions addressing fall risk prevention were evaluated according to set criteria based on the functional requirements of the project. Firstly, positive and negative aspects of the individual cites were summarized and then a matrix was construced, see Table \ref{table:evaluationMatrix}, summarizing how all the different cites fufilled the pre-defined requiremtns.
\subsection{Evaluation Criteria}
In order to evaluate the different solutions, the most characteristic functional requirements of the desired solution were selecetd. The selected requiremetnts were (for full description of functional requirements see Table \ref{table:funcReq}):

F1: Register user profile

F4: Log in functionality for users 

F6: Invite friends to events 

F9: View personal fitness information

F13: Add friends to personal network

F15: Download app(s)

F16: View exercises

F17: Take a fitness test

F19: Basic information about fall risk

\hline \rowcolor{lightgray}
Pros & Cons \\
\hline
The site offers brochures with exercise programs to prevent falls. They appear inspiring and include positive images. The downside is that they are not free & 
The geographical connection of the site is unsuitable for our purposes. It offers link to several California based services, which naturally are of no importance to Norwegian seniors.  \\ 
\hline
The site has a DVD with more exercises one can do at home to prevent falls, but this DVD is not free either.
 & The language of the site of naturally an obstacle, but the development team can nonetheless  use the site as inspiration. \\

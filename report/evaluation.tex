\section{Requirements met}
\subsection{Functional}
Based on the unit tests which pass, we know which functional requirements are met:
Following is a list of the functional requirements of the system which are implemented and working: 
\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item FR1
    \item FR2
    \item FR3
    \item FR4
    \item FR6
    \item FR7
    \item FR8 N/A
    \item FR9
    \item FR10
    \item FR13
    \item FR15
    \item FR16
    \item FR17
    \item FR18
    \item FR19
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

See Table \ref{table:funcReq} for a detailed description of the functional requirements.

\subsection{Non-functional}
//This section will be filled in in the final version of the report.
\textbf{Usability}
(Evaluate according to senior usability guidelines form pre-study??)
\section{Requirements not met}
\subsection{Functional}
Based on the unit tests which do not pass, we know which functional requirements that are not met in the final solution:  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item FR5
    \item FR11
    \item FR12
    \item FR14
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Non-functional}
//This section will be filled in in the final version of the report.
